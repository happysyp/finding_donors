# Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project, several supervised algorithms was employed to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm was chosen from preliminary results and this algorithm was further optimized to best model the data. The goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. 

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid".
